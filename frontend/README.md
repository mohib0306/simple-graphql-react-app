# React Frontend Application - Create React App

React frontend application connects to GraphQL backend and serves user's requests.

## Getting Started

To start the frontend application, navigate to the `frontend` directory and then;

1. Create `.env` file in the `frontend` folder and add `PORT=8080` line. This port will be used to spawn react application. If this port is used by any other application or service on your machine, change it to your desired one
2. In a separate terminal (or terminal tab) run `npm install` => installs required npm packages.
3. In the same terminal `npm start` => this will start the `react-app` server on port 8080 (or whatevent you specified in the `.env` file).

_P.S. Make sure that the backend servers are running. See [Backend Readme](https://github.com/mohib0306/simple-graphql-react-app/tree/master/backend)._
